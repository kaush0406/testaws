I hope this message finds you well. I have a query regarding Mo-28420 and the new COS (Change of Specification) that introduces a check to verify if the GAID (Google Advertising ID) has a plan level AMD (Account Management Document) setup, irrespective of any errors found. Specifically, I seek clarification on whether we are required to perform this check for all GAIDs, regardless of their status with either an INVALID IRS Code or an Inconsistent IRS code, or if this check should only apply to GAIDs that pass both these tests.


Following up on our discussion last Tuesday regarding the implementation of the new specifications outlined in Mo-28420, we were previously informed that the verification check for a valid AMD plan for GAIDs was to be conducted only after passing the initial two checks.

However, upon reviewing the COS documentation, it explicitly states that the verification is necessary "regardless of any identified errors," indicating that the check for a valid AMD plan should be conducted irrespective of the results of prior checks.

Could you kindly provide clarification on this discrepancy? Specifically, we seek guidance on whether the validation for a valid AMD plan should be carried out after GAIDs pass the initial two checks or if it should be performed regardless of the results of these checks.
