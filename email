I hope this message finds you well. I have a query regarding Mo-28420 and the new COS (Change of Specification) that introduces a check to verify if the GAID (Google Advertising ID) has a plan level AMD (Account Management Document) setup, irrespective of any errors found. Specifically, I seek clarification on whether we are required to perform this check for all GAIDs, regardless of their status with either an INVALID IRS Code or an Inconsistent IRS code, or if this check should only apply to GAIDs that pass both these tests.
